        <p>My hobbies include knife making, ring making, leather working,
          singing, and playing piano.</p>
        <p>I started making rings last summer. My wife and son were
          away most of that summer visiting family. I had a lot of
          time on my hands.<br>So, after watching some professionals
          on YouTube, I decided to give it a try. </p>
